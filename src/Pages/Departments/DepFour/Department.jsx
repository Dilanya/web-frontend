                  Welcome to the Department of Anthropology and Gerontology at
                  the National Institute of Social Development (NISD). Committed

                  the global education system, garnering acclaim for its
                  comprehensive study programs. In our commitment to teaching
                  and research, we aim to cultivate individuals who possess not
                  only a deep understanding of the theoretical foundations but
                  are also equipped with the practical skills essential for
                  addressing real-world challenges in the realms of anthropology
                  and gerontology muti disciplinary practice. Recognizing the
                  importance of inclusivity and accessibility in education, the
                  Department of Anthropology and Gerontology actively
                  contributes to NISD's overarching mission of providing higher

            The Bachelor of Social Work degree programme conducted by the NISD
            aims to produce professional social workers with a good grasp of
            social work values, capable of managing social welfare services,
            competent to engage in quality teaching and research and promote
            peace and harmony in a multi-ethnic Sri Lanka. The Bachelorâ€™s degree
            course in Social Work is a full time four year programme. It is
            conducted in eight semesters, through class room lessons,
            on-site-teaching-learning methods and guided field practice. Within
            the four year study period, two fieldwork placements (in the 2nd &
            4th years) are conducted. In these two Block field placements,
            students learn the practice of social work in communities and
            agencies under the close supervision of trained professional social
            workers. The placements are full time and conducted during a total
            time period of twenty four weeks. This professional course
            anticipates the students to be committed learners working with
            people in need.
