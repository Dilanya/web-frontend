            The Bachelor of Social Work degree programme conducted by the NISD
            aims to produce professional social workers with a good grasp of
            social work values, capable of managing social welfare services,
            competent to engage in quality teaching and research and promote
            peace and harmony in a multi-ethnic Sri Lanka. The Bachelorâ€™s degree
            course in Social Work is a full time four year programme. It is
            conducted in eight semesters, through class room lessons,
            on-site-teaching-learning methods and guided field practice. Within
            the four year study period, two fieldwork placements (in the 2nd &
            4th years) are conducted. In these two Block field placements,
            students learn the practice of social work in communities and
            agencies under the close supervision of trained professional social
            workers. The placements are full time and conducted during a total
            time period of twenty four weeks. This professional course
            anticipates the students to be committed learners working with
            people in need.
